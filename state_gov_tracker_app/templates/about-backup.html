            <h2>What is StateRep.Me?</h2>
            <p>StateRep.Me was conceived and developed during <a href="http://www.hacksfordemocracy.org/">Hacks4Democracy</a>, a Fall 2012 <a href="http://www.azavea.com/">Azavea</a>-sponsored civic hackathon in Philadelphia, PA.  A collaborative project from Jason Blanchard, Josh Borkowski, Christopher Brown, Joshua Darr, Lauren Gilchrist, Christopher Nies, Andrew Thompson, and Nickolas Weingartner, StateRep.me compiles the votes, press releases, tweets, and Facebook posts of all Pennsylvania state legislators in one simple web portal to enable easy tracking of legislative actions by individual representatives. Searchable by address, the goal of the application is to increase legislator accountability and constituent engagement by reducing the time and effort it takes to monitor the Pennsylvania state legislature.</p>

He loves being in Philly surrounded by so much open data and talented civic hackers.

                    Chris #1 is a PhD candidate in the Political Science Department at the University of Pennsylvania.  His research focuses on Congress and the application of natural language processing to help answer enduring questions about legislative activity.  Chris #1’s academic experience ranges from research to predict the spread of conventional weapons to using text from the Congressional Record to measure partisan rhetoric on political blogs.  Chris uses a variety of tools to get his work done, including R and Stata for statistical analyses; Python for text processing, web-scraping, and machine learning; and D3.js to produce visualizations for StateRep.Me.  When Chris #1 isn’t working on StateRep.Me he can be found obsessing over his NBA fantasy basketball team, finding some interesting data to scrape off the web, or baking cheesecakes.

                    Chris #2 is a QA Engineer at DLC Solutions, where he ensures website quality (using both manual and automated testing), provides UI/UX feedback and design, and generally raises a ruckus.  Comfortable as a coder as well as a tester, Chris #2 works primarily in Python and JavaScript to develop tools to automate tasks that he doesn't really feel like doing manually (such as API testing and data analysis).  He's put his tool-building skills to work in industries as diverse as locomotive manufacture (GE Transportation), Pharmaceuticals (AstraZeneca), intellectual property law, and (of course) web design.  Passionate about the intersection of technology and urban life, Chris #2 wrote, recorded, and edited a podcast on urbanism and design for over a year, and has since brought his passion for urban living to the Philadelphia civic hacking community.  He enjoys coding, writing about bags, urban cycling, and a good IPA.

                        </div>
                    Andrew is the Community Evangelist at Azavea, where he organizes and attends hackathons (like the <a href="http://www.hacksfordemocracy.org/">Hacks4Democracy</a> where StateRep.me was founded) and fosters growing user communities around Azavea's geospatial open source and API products.  The youngest member of the team, Andrew came to the Philadelphia area from Massachusetts 4 years ago to attend Haverford College.  He graduated in 2012 with a BA in <a href="http://www.brynmawr.edu/cities/">Growth and Structure of Cities</a> and a minor in <a href="http://www.haverford.edu/computerscience/">Computer Science</a> with more than enough other classes in between.

                    The quintessential liberal arts grad, Andrew can talk urban policy and marketing with Lauren, politics with Chris #1, code with Jason and Chris #2, and even handle journalists given his former life as a reporter and editor with <a href="http://www.biconews.com/">The Bi-College News</a>. También, él puede hacer todas estas cosas en español si alguien quiere.  But that doesn't happen often. When he's not helping StateRep.me or at a hackathon for Azavea, you'll probably find Andrew at a <a href="http://www.pym.org/programs/young-adult-friends">Quaker gathering</a>.

            <h2>About the StateRep.Me Data</h2>
            <p>StateRep.Me is constructed using a combination of publicly available and unique web-scraped data:</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Cicero</dt>
                    <dd>Azavea’s <a href="http://www.azavea.com/products/cicero/">Cicero API</a>, a custom geocoder that matches addresses to legislative districts and elected official information, powers StateRep.Me’s address search functionality.  The StateRep.Me team has also used it to develop lists of Twitter and Facebook handles for Pennsylvania representatives. </dd>
                <dt>Open States</dt>
                    <dd>A project of the <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/">Sunlight Foundation</a>, the <a href="http://openstates.org/api/">Open States API</a> powers StateRep.Me's list of Pennsylvania state legislators, including contact information and voting history.</dd>
                <dt>Press Releases</dt>
                    <dd>The StateRep.Me Team gathers press releases from each legislator's website to generate the list of press releases. In the spirit of open data, StateRep.Me recently released these <a href="http://beta.staterep.me/blog/post_num/2">data as an API</a>.</dd>
                <dt>Ideology Scoring</dt>
                    <dd>Calculated using a Bayesian item response model developed by political scientists <a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=228449">Simon Jackman, Joshua Clinton, and Douglas Rivers</a> using the voting history of each legislator. To estimate preferences/ideology, this model uses differences in roll call voting behavior in the Pennsylvania General Assembly to scale legislators on a single dimension (the left-to-right political axis). This method is preferable over other measures that only use a subjective number or list of roll call votes to create an ideology score for each member based on a subset of votes and is the same method used to measure ideology for members of Congress and Supreme Court Justices in the political science literature.</dd>
                <dt>Facebook Posts</dt>
                    <dd>Using <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/">Facebook's API</a>, StateRep.Me collects each legislator's Facebook posts in near-real time.</dd>
